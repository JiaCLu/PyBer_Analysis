# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The PyBer Analysis project collaborate with Omar to create a summary of DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. We utilized Python skills, Pandas and Matplotlib to create line graph that shows total weekly fares for each city type: rural, suburban, urban.

## Resources:
CyBer Analysis using Python programing language, Pandas library, Matplotlib to create graph.

## Results:

The result of this analysis provide summary of ride share in each city as follow:

Three city type total rides, drivers, and fares are following:
* Urban city has the highest total rides of 1625 with total drivers operate 2405, with the highest total fares.
* Rural city has the lowest total rides whereas average fare per ride and per driver are the highest which indicate each driver earn more than other two cities.
* This summary data can easily to visualize by categorize cities in the row, and rides, drivers, total fares in the column.

## Summary:

There are three recommendations to CEO based on the PyBer Analysis:
1. Since Urban has the highest number of return on investment, focus on rural city.
2. Increase more drivers in rural city in order to meet high demand.
3. Based on the summary analysis, rural city's average fare per ride and driver are the highest among three cities, hire more drivers to lower average fare per each driver to ensure each driver can increase the number of trip during the high demand season.
